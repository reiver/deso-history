This history is in reverse-chronological order — with the _newest_ stuff _first_, and the _oldest_ stuff _last_.

# Year 2020

**Yahoo! Groups**, free hosted **mailing-lists** and **web-forums**, shut-down by Yahoo!

First known **computerized bulletin board system** (**CBBS**) goes online.
(Note that this is pre-mass-Internet. So "_going online_" meant something different back then — so it had nothing to do with the Internet.) 

# Year 1971

The **finger-protocol** (and `finger` program) was created.
Although _finger_ was NOT designed to be technology for social-media (and was _not_ used as a social-media technology in the 1970s), people eventually used it as social-media.
