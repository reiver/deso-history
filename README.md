The **finger-protocol** (and `finger` program) was created.

This (social-media usage of _finger_) was popular in the 1990s.
But, as the Web became popular in the mid- to late 1990s, this usage of _finger_ was replaced by personal web-sites, and the _ad hoc_ and _informal_ social-networks that were creating with it (via linking).
